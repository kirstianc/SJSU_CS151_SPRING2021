Main differences between primitive "int" and class "Integer"
- The primitive cannot do methods that are contained in the Integer class
    so the flexibility and usefulness of the primitive type is contained
    within only holding a 32-bit integer.

Advantages of primitive "int"
- Can use == and != with primitive types.
- Simplicity and performance, if you only need to contain a number.

Advantages of class "Integer"
- Inherently contains a primitive int
- Contains useful methods, such as converting int to String or vice verse,
    even converting the int to a float, double, etc.
